👉🏻JavaScript Engine
JavaScript code we write cannot be understood by the computer
A JavaScript engine is a program that converts javascript code that developers
write into machine code that allows a computer to perform specific tasks
JavaScript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors
V8 - Open-source JavaScript Engine developed by Google for Chrome
SpiderMonkey - – The JavaScript Engine powering Mozilla Firefox
JavaScriptCore - Open-source JavaScript Engine developed by Apple for
Safari
Chakra - A JavaScript Engine for the original Microsoft Edge (The latest
version of edge uses V8)

👉🏻V8 JavaScript Engine
V8 is Google's open source JavaScript engine.
V8 implements ECMAScript as specified in ECMA-262.
V8 is written in C++ and is used in Google Chrome, the open source browser from Google.
V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

👉🏻Chrome's V8 Engine & Node.js
Chrome's V8 engine by Google sits at the core of Node.js
By embedding V8 into your own C++ application, you can write C++ code that
gets executed when a user writes JavaScript code
You can add new features to JavaScript itself
Since C++ is great for lower level operations like file handling, database
connections and network operations, by embedding V8 into your own C++
program, you have the power to add all of that functionality in JavaScript
The C++ program we're talking about is Node.js*
(* Node.js is a lot more than just a C++ program)

👉🏻Chrome's V8 Engine Summary
A JavaScript engine is a program that executes JavaScript code
In 2008, Google created its own JavaScript engine called V8
V8 is written in C++ and can be used independently or can be embedded into
other C++ programs
That allows you to write your own C++ programs which can do everything that V8
can do and more
Your C++ program can run ECMAScript and additional features that you choose to
incorporate
For example, features that are available in C++ but not available with JavaScript
