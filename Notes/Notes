ENV :=

The .env file is a simple text file that stores environment variables for an application. It's commonly used to store sensitive configuration settings, such as API keys, database credentials, and other values that might vary across different environments (development, staging, production). By keeping these settings in a separate file, they can be managed more easily and securely, and the code itself remains cleaner. 
Key-Value Pairs:
The file contains key-value pairs, where the key is the name of the environment variable, and the value is its corresponding value. 
Security:
.env files are typically excluded from version control systems (e.g., Git) to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information. 
Flexibility:
They allow for easy adaptation to different environments by simply modifying the values in the .env file. 
Database Credentials: DB_HOST=localhost, DB_USER=myuser, DB_PASSWORD=mypassword
API Keys: API_KEY=your_api_key, GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key. 
Application Settings: DEBUG=True, SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key

Nodejs Implementation : 
1. npm i dotenv
2. in the main server.js file (where the port is running), import dotenv page require('dotenv').config(); This command will help access the env variables in all other files because all files are run throught server.js
3. Now whereever you want to use the variables defined in the .env file, just use process.env.VARIABLE

Note : Sometimes, the file doesn't recognize what process.env.VARIABLE is, for that import the dotenv package in that specific file again 

The process object is a Node.js object. It provides information about, and control over, the current Node.js process. It is a global object, meaning it is always available in Node.js applications without requiring an import statement. While Node.js uses JavaScript as its language, the process object itself is not a standard JavaScript object available in browser environments. It's specific to the Node.js runtime environment.

Mongoose for MongoDB :=
>> npm i mongoose
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, a NoSQL database. It provides a higher-level abstraction for working with MongoDB, making it easier for developers to interact with the database using JavaScript. Mongoose simplifies data modeling, schema creation, and validation, allowing developers to work with MongoDB in a more structured and intuitive way.
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
ODM (Object Data Modeling):
Mongoose allows developers to model data using JavaScript objects, which are then mapped to MongoDB documents. 
Schema-based:
Mongoose uses schemas to define the structure of documents in MongoDB collections, ensuring data integrity and consistency. 
Simplifies database interaction:
Mongoose provides a more developer-friendly way to interact with MongoDB compared to using the native MongoDB driver, which requires more manual query building and schema management. 
Benefits of using Mongoose: 
Easier data modeling: Mongoose makes it easier to create and manage data structures, especially for complex applications. 
Built-in features: Mongoose includes features like type casting, validation, and query building, reducing the need for manual coding. 
Improved code organization: Using Mongoose can lead to cleaner and more organized code, as it handles many of the low-level database operations.

Without Mongoose package, we have to use mongodb package(npm i mongodb) to insert data in DB, but mongodb package doesn't provide schemas or validations at the application level. 
Mongoose provide more facilities and security then mongodb. 
If you don't want to create schema and just want to insert data for small project, use mongodb. But if you want more restriction and validations, use mongoose.
mongodb : 
No schemas or validations at the application level.
No middleware/hooks (like pre-save, post-remove).
You must manually handle: Validation, Relationships, Data transformations, Timestamps, defaults, etc.
mongoose : 
Built on top of the mongodb driver.
Adds schema definitions, model-based data access, and validation.
Offers middlewares, virtuals, population (joins), plugins, etc.

Guide on how to use Mongoose to connect to MongoDB, define a schema, and perform basic queries :
✅ 1. Install Mongoose
npm install mongoose

✅ 2. Connect to MongoDB

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const url = 'mongodb+srv://jubernowawave:JUBERkhan%40123@cluster0.n4tvq.mongodb.net/Eportal'; // connection url from mongodb atlas

mongoose.connect(url, {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true
})
.then(() => console.log('MongoDB connected'))
.catch(err => console.error('MongoDB connection error:', err));

✅ 3. Define a Schema & Model
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
0  first_name: { type: String, required: true },
  last_name : String,
  age: Number,                           // Number
  isActive: Boolean,                     // Boolean
  birthday: Date,                        // Date
  profilePic: Buffer,                    // Binary Buffer. Used for storing binary data like files, images, or encrypted content.
  sport: {                             // ObjectId reference
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Sports' // ObjectId from Sports collection/table
  },
  tags: [String],                        // Array of Strings
  preferences: mongoose.Schema.Types.Mixed, // Mixed. A flexible type that can hold any kind of value — object, array, string, etc.
  meta: {                                // Map of dynamic keys
    type: Map,
    of: String
  },
  price: mongoose.Schema.Types.Decimal128, //  Used for storing high-precision decimal numbers (like currency). eg: 999.99
}, {
  timestamps: true // adds createdAt and updatedAt
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
module.exports = User;

✅ 4. Use the Model to Perform Queries
const User = require('./models/User');

// Create a new user
const newUser = await User.create({ name: 'Alice', age: 25, email: 'alice@example.com' });

// Find one user
const foundUser = await User.findOne({ name: 'Alice' });

// Update a user
await User.updateOne({ name: 'Alice' }, { age: 26 });

// Delete a user
await User.deleteOne({ name: 'Alice' });

// Find all users
const allUsers = await User.find();

💡 Pro Tips:
You can use Mongoose middleware (e.g. pre('save')) for logic before/after database actions.

Add custom methods or virtual fields on schemas.

Use .lean() for faster queries if you don’t need Mongoose documents.


🛠 Notes:
Mixed: Useful for flexible or dynamic structures, but disables strict schema enforcement.
Map: Good for storing arbitrary key-value pairs (e.g., localized content).
Decimal128: Use when you need accurate decimal math (e.g., currency).
UUID: Not natively supported in schema types — use as a String or with a plugin.

Buffer : 
Used for storing binary data like files, images, or encrypted content.
 
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const fileSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  fileName: String,
  data: Buffer,
  contentType: String
});

const File = mongoose.model('File', fileSchema);


const fs = require('fs');

const image = fs.readFileSync('path/to/image.jpg');
await File.create({
  fileName: 'image.jpg',
  data: image,
  contentType: 'image/jpeg'
});


🔹 3. Decimal128
➤ Used for storing high-precision decimal numbers (like currency). Avoids floating point errors found in Number.

const productSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  price: mongoose.Schema.Types.Decimal128
});

const Product = mongoose.model('Product', productSchema);

await Product.create({
  name: 'Laptop',
  price: mongoose.Types.Decimal128.fromString('999.99')
});

const item = await Product.findOne();
console.log(item.price.toString()); // '999.99'

🔹 4. Map
➤ Used to store dynamic key-value pairs. All values in a map must be of the same type.
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  settings: {
    type: Map,
    of: String
  }
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
await User.create({
  name: 'Alice',
  settings: {
    theme: 'dark',
    language: 'en',
    timezone: 'IST'
  }
});
const user = await User.findOne({ name: 'Alice' });
console.log(user.settings.get('theme')); // 'dark'

why use map method .get() : 
console.log(user.settings.theme);      // ❌ Might be undefined
console.log(user.settings['theme']);  // ❌ Unreliable

These methods may not work reliably because Mongoose's Map is not a plain JavaScript object — it's an instance of Map under the hood and behaves differently from plain objects.
They may appear to work in some cases (e.g., after converting the document to a plain object), but they’re not safe.
Convert to a plain object (if needed) :
If you really want to use object-style access, convert the map to a plain object.
const settingsObj = Object.fromEntries(user.settings);
console.log(settingsObj.theme); // ✅ Safe after conversion
or
console.log(user.settings.toObject().theme);

express.json()

app.use(express.json());
express.json() is a built-in middleware function in Express.js that parses incoming requests with JSON payloads. It handles JSON data sent from clients and makes it accessible within your server-side application. This allows you to easily work with data sent by clients, especially when building RESTful APIs that use JSON. 

Here's a more detailed explanation:
Parsing JSON:
When a client sends data to your server in the form of JSON, express.json() parses this JSON data and attaches it to the req.body property of the request object. 
Accessibility:
This means you can access the parsed JSON data within your route handlers using req.body. For example, req.body.name would give you access to the 'name' field in the JSON data sent from the client. 
Middleware Function:
express.json() is a middleware function, meaning it's a piece of code that can modify the request object or respond to a request. It's typically used with app.use() to apply it globally or with individual routes for more targeted parsing. 
body-parser Dependency:
Historically, Express.js relied on the body-parser library for parsing request bodies. However, in newer versions of Express, express.json() is now a direct part of the framework and essentially replaces the need for body-parser when dealing with JSON data. 

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Use express.json() as middleware
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  // req.body now contains the parsed JSON data
  const jsonData = req.body;
  console.log(jsonData);  // Output: { name: 'John', age: 30 }
  res.json({ message: 'Data received successfully' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});

In this example, any request sent to /api/data with a JSON payload will have its data parsed and made available in req.body. This makes it easy to access and work with the data within the route handler. 


CORS (cross origin resource sharing)
It is a security feature built into web browsers that controls how resources on a server can be requested from another domain (or "origin") outside the one the resource originated from.
CORS is a protocol that uses HTTP headers to tell browsers whether a specific web application running at one origin is allowed to access resources from a different origin.
Example scenario:
1. Your frontend is hosted at https://example-frontend.com.
2. Your backend API is hosted at https://api.example-backend.com.
3. The browser blocks API requests from frontend to backend unless the backend includes proper CORS headers (e.g., Access-Control-Allow-Origin).

✅ Why do we need CORS in the backend?
Security: Prevent unauthorized websites from reading sensitive data from your server.
Controlled Sharing: Only allow access to known and trusted frontend domains.
Avoid Same-Origin Policy issues: Browsers enforce the Same-Origin Policy, which blocks cross-origin requests by default for security.
CORS allows safe and secure controlled exceptions to this rule.

app.use(cors()); in Express:
This line tells your Express.js app to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) with default settings.

🔍 What it does exactly:
Allows requests from any origin (Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *)
Does not allow credentials (like cookies, sessions, or Authorization headers)

Tip : to restrict public usage of your api and only allow defined frontend domain to access your backend APIs : 
app.use(cors({
  origin: 'http://your-frontend.com',
  methods: ['GET', 'HEAD', 'PUT'], // only these methods will be allowed, all the rest methods PATCH, POST, DELETE will be blocked
}));

When you use: app.use(cors());
It's shorthand for: 
app.use(cors({
  origin: '*',
  methods: ['GET', 'HEAD', 'PUT', PATCH, POST, DELETE'],
}));


JWT (jsonwebtocken)
1. user login with his credentials
2. authenticate his credentials(email-password) from backend
3. if authenticated, fetch user data from db and convert that user data to jwt token and send to frontend
4. frontend get the token and store it in cookies.
5. backend create a verifyToken api to verify the token
6. frontend send token in verifyToken api in the headers
7. Backed verify the token and send the actual user data.
8. The actual user data will be saved in the context.
9. The jwt token is stay till its expiry date in the cookie.
10. On Every refresh, the verifyToken api is called with the jwt token (to convert token to userdata)
11. verifyToken :- 
	Error : After receiving the error(invalid token, expired token), the frontend should log out the user and redirect to login page to generate the jwt again (from step 1)
	Success : store encrypted userdata in context that was send from verifyToken api
