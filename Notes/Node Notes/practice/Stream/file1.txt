Hello AvinashTemperature is a measure of how hot or cold something is, indicating the direction in which heat energy will spontaneously flow. It's a physical quantity representing the average kinetic energy of the particles within a substance. Common temperature scales include Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Temperature as a measure of hotness/coldness:
Temperature quantifies the attribute of hotness or coldness. 
It's a way to express the degree of heat present in a substance. 
We perceive temperature through our sense of touch, feeling the difference between hot and cold. 
Temperature and heat:
Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. 
Heat is the transfer of energy between objects due to a temperature difference. 
Heat flows from a hotter object to a colder object. 
It takes heat to raise the temperature of an object. 
Temperature scales:
Celsius (C):
Commonly used in most of the world, with the freezing point of water at 0째C and boiling point at 100째C. 
Fahrenheit (F):
Used in the US and some other countries, with the freezing point of water at 32째F and boiling point at 212째F. 
Kelvin (K):
Used by scientists, with 0K representing absolute zero (the coldest temperature possible). 
Rankine (R):
Another scale used in scientific contexts. 
Temperature and molecular motion:
At a higher temperature, molecules within a substance move faster and more vigorously.
This increased molecular motion is reflected in the substance's increased temperature. 
Temperature in different states of matter:
In solids and liquids, molecules vibrate around a fixed point.
In gases, molecules are in free flight and constantly colliding with each other.
