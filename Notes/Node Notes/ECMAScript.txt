👉🏻ECMAScript
In 1993, the first web browser with a user interface called Mosaic was released
In 1994, the lead developers of Mosaic founded a company called Netscape and released a more polished browser called Netscape Navigator
Web pages could only be static and there was no interactivity after a page was
loaded
In 1995, Netscape created a new scripting language called JavaScript
The name was purely for marketing purpose as Java was the hot new language
back then

👉🏻The advent of Microsoft
In 1995, Microsoft debuted their browser Internet Explorer
Microsoft realised that JavaScript fundamentally changed the user experience of the web
and wanted the same for internet explorer
But there was no specification for them to follow
In 1996, Microsoft reverse-engineered the Navigator interpreter to create its own
scripting language called JScript
The differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both
browsers
"Best viewed in Netscape” and “Best viewed in Internet Explorer" badges became
common

👉🏻Ecma International
In Nov 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International
It is an industry association dedicated to the standardization of information and
communication systems
Netscape wanted a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform
to as it would help keep other implementations consistent across browsers
For each new specification Ecma provides a standard specification and a
committee
In case of JavaScript, the standard is called ECMA-262 and the committee that
works on ECMA-262 is called Technical Committee 39 (TC39)
Ecma however decided to use the term "ECMAScript" to talk about the official
language
The reason for this is because Oracle (who acquired Microsystems) owns the
trademark for the term "JavaScript"
ECMAScript refers to the standard language whereas JavaScript is what we use
in practice and builds on top of ECMAScript

👉🏻ECMAScript versions
1997 - ECMAScript 1
1998 - ECMAScript 2
1999 - ECMAScript 3
ECMAScript 4 never released
2009 - ECMAScript 5
2015 - ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)
One version every year since 2015

👉🏻ECMAScript Summary
ECMA-262 is the language specification
ECMAScript is the language that implements ECMA-262
JavaScript is basically ECMAScript at its core but builds on top of that
